# ImplementationLogGenerator
Console app that tracks time that a log is being worked on, adds comments if typed.

Made to save me time of tracking when I am doing work and how long for as assignments often times require an implementation log to be kept.
Potential improvements:
> add total time worked on calculator
> support word docs to fill a table with logs and entries
> GUI
